Chao, D. (2023) 50-minute tutor session. * Helped me restructure lines of my code into different sections. * Explained why I did not need to create a Dim for each object and instead reference certain columns as a range. * I had the "Yearly Change" column prepared to divide the "yearly change" number by another number, but I was not sure which other number that should be. Mr. Chao helped explain the logic as to why it should be divided by the "open" figure.
